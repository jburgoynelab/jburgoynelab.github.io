	<b>Abstract</b>: Genes that are highly conserved in food seeking behaviour, such as protein kinase G (PKG), are of interest because of their potential role in the global obesity epidemic. PKG1&alpha; can be activated by binding of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) or oxidant-induced interprotein disulfide bond formation between the two subunits of this homodimeric kinase. PKG1&alpha; activation by cGMP plays a role in reward and addiction through its actions in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of the brain. â€˜Redox dead' C42S PKG1&alpha; knock-in (KI) mice, which are fully deficient in oxidant-induced disulfide-PKG1&alpha; formation, display increased food seeking and reward behaviour compared to wild-type (WT) littermates. Rewarding monoamines such as dopamine, which are released during feeding, are metabolised by monoamine oxidase to generate hydrogen peroxide that was shown to mediate PKG1&alpha; oxidation. Indeed, inhibition of monoamine oxidase, which prevents it producing hydrogen peroxide, attenuated PKG1&alpha; oxidation and increased sucrose preference in WT, but not KI mice. The deficient reward phenotype of the KI mice was rescued by expressing WT kinase that can form the disulfide state in the VTA using an adeno-associated virus, consistent with PKG1&alpha; oxidation providing a break on feeding behaviour. In conclusion, disulfide-PKG1&alpha; in VTA neurons acts as a negative regulator of feeding and therefore may provide a novel therapeutic target for obesity.

	<b>Abstract</b>: Background: The health-promoting and disease-limiting abilities of resveratrol, a natural polyphenol, has led to considerable interest in understanding the mechanisms of its therapeutic actions. The polyphenolic rings of resveratrol enable it to react with and detoxify otherwise injurious oxidants. Whilst the protective actions of resveratrol are commonly ascribed to its antioxidant activity, here we show that this is a misconception. Methods: The ability of resveratrol to oxidize cGMP-dependent PKG1&alpha; (protein kinase 1&alpha;) was assessed in isolated rat aortic smooth muscle cells, and the mechanism of action of this polyphenol was characterized using in vitro experiments, mass spectrometry and electron paramagnetic resonance. The blood pressure of wild-type and C42S knock-in mice was assessed using implanted telemetry probes. Mice were made hypertensive by administration of angiotensin II via osmotic mini-pumps and blood pressure monitored during 15 days of feeding with chow diet containing vehicle or resveratrol. Results: Oxidation of the phenolic rings of resveratrol paradoxically leads to oxidative modification of proteins, explained by formation of a reactive quinone that oxidizes the thiolate side chain of cysteine residues; events that were enhanced in cells under oxidative stress. Consistent with these observations and its ability to induce vasodilation, resveratrol induced oxidative activation of PKG1&alpha; and lowered blood pressure in hypertensive wild-type mice, but not C42S PKG1&alpha; knock-in mice that are resistant to disulfide activation. Conclusions: Resveratrol mediates lowering of blood pressure by paradoxically inducing protein oxidation, especially during times of oxidative stress, a mechanism that may be a common feature of antioxidant molecules.

	<b>Abstract</b>: Dysfunctional macroautophagy/autophagy has been causatively linked to aging and the pathogenesis of many diseases, which are also broadly characterized by dysregulated cellular redox. As the autophagy-related (ATG) conjugation systems that mediate autophagosome maturation are cysteine dependent, their oxidation may account for loss in this catabolic process under conditions of oxidative stress. During active autophagy, LC3 is transferred from the catalytic thiol of ATG7 to the active site thiol of ATG3, where it is conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine. In our recent study, we show LC3 is bound to the catalytic thiols of inactive ATG3 and ATG7 through a stable thioester, which becomes transient upon autophagy stimulation. Transient interaction with LC3 exposes the catalytic thiols on ATG3 and ATG7, which under pro-oxidizing conditions undergo inhibitory oxidation. This process was found to be upregulated in aged mouse tissue and therefore may account, at least in part, for impaired autophagy observed during aging.

	<b>Abstract</b>: Macroautophagy (autophagy) is a crucial cellular stress response for degrading defective macromolecules and organelles, as well as providing bioenergetic intermediates during hypoxia and nutrient deprivation. Here we report a thiol-dependent process that may account for impaired autophagy during aging. This is through direct oxidation of key autophagy-related (Atg) proteins Atg3 and Atg7. When inactive Atg3 and Atg7 are protected from oxidation due to stable covalent interaction with their substrate LC3. This interaction becomes transient upon activation of Atg3 and Atg7 due to transfer of LC3 to phosphatidylethanolamine (lipidation), a process crucial for functional autophagy. However, loss in covalent-bound LC3 also sensitizes the catalytic thiols of Atg3 and Atg7 to inhibitory oxidation that prevents LC3 lipidation, observed in vitro and in mouse aorta. Here findings provide a thiol-dependent process for negatively regulating autophagy that may contribute to the process of aging, as well as therapeutic targets to regulate autophagosome maturation.

	<b>Abstract</b>: Background Type 2A protein phosphatase (PP2A) enzymes are serine/threonine phosphatases which comprise a scaffold A subunit, a regulatory B subunit and a catalytic C subunit, and have been implicated in the dephosphorylation of multiple cardiac phosphoproteins. B subunits determine subcellular targeting, substrate specificity and catalytic activity, and can themselves be regulated by post-translational modifications. We explored potential &beta;-adrenergic regulation of PP2A in cardiomyocytes through phosphorylation of the regulatory B subunit isoform B56&delta;. Methods and results Phosphate affinity SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis revealed increased phosphorylation of B56&delta; in adult rat ventricular myocytes (ARVM) exposed to the &beta;-adrenergic receptor (&beta;AR) agonist isoprenaline (ISO). Phosphorylation of B56&delta; occurred at S573, primarily through stimulation of the &beta; 1 AR subtype, and was dependent on PKA activity. The functional role of the phosphorylation was explored in ARVM transduced with adenoviruses expressing wild type (WT) or non-phosphorylatable (S573A) B56&delta;, fused to GFP at the N-terminus. C subunit expression was increased in ARVM expressing GFP-B56&delta;-WT or GFP-B56&delta;-S573A, both of which co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous C and A subunits. PP2A activity in cell lysates was increased in response to ISO in ARVM expressing GFP-B56&delta;-WT but not GFP-B56&delta;-S573A. Immunoblot analysis of the phosphoproteome in ARVM expressing GFP-B56&delta;-WT or GFP-B56&delta;-S573A with antibodies detecting (i) phospho-serine/threonine residues in distinct kinase substrate motifs or (ii) specific phosphorylated residues of functional importance in selected proteins revealed a comparable phosphorylation profile in the absence or presence of ISO stimulation. Conclusions In cardiomyocytes, &beta;AR stimulation induces PKA-mediated phosphorylation of the PP2A regulatory subunit isoform B56&delta; at S573, which increases associated PP2A catalytic activity. This is likely to regulate the phosphorylation status of specific B56&delta;-PP2A substrates, which remain to be identified.

	<b>Abstract</b>: S-nitrosation, commonly referred to as S-nitrosylation, is widely regarded as a ubiquitous, stable post-translational modification that directly regulates many proteins. Such a widespread role would appear to be incompatible with the inherent lability of the S-nitroso bond, especially its propensity to rapidly react with thiols to generate disulfide bonds. As anticipated, we observed robust and widespread protein S-nitrosation after exposing cells to nitrosocysteine or lipopolysaccharide. Proteins detected using the ascorbate-dependent biotin switch method are typically interpreted to be directly regulated by S-nitrosation. However, these S-nitrosated proteins are shown to predominantly comprise transient intermediates leading to disulfide bond formation. These disulfides are likely to be the dominant end effectors resulting from elevations in nitrosating cellular nitric oxide species. We propose that S-nitrosation primarily serves as a transient intermediate leading to disulfide formation. Overall, we conclude that the current widely held perception that stable S-nitrosation directly regulates the function of many proteins is significantly incorrect. Nitric oxide-related molecules post-translationally modify protein thiols, resulting in functional changes. Such S-nitrosothiols are widely thought to be regulatory end effector modifications. However, Wolhuter et al. show that S-nitrosation predominantly serves as a transient intermediate in the formation of disulfide bonds. This furthers our understanding of how nitric oxide regulates signaling.

	<b>Abstract</b>: The kinase p38&alpha; MAPK (p38&alpha;) plays a pivotal role in many biological processes. p38&alpha; is activated by canonical upstream kinases that phosphorylate the activation region. The purpose of our study was to determine whether such activation may depend on redox-sensing cysteines within p38&alpha;. p38&alpha; was activated and formed a disulfide-bound heterodimer with MAP2K3 (MKK3) in rat cardiomyocytes and isolated hearts exposed to H2O2. This disulfide heterodimer was sensitive to reduction by mercaptoethanol and was enhanced by the thioredoxin-reductase inhibitor auranofin. We predicted that Cys-119 or Cys-162 of p38&alpha;, close to the known MKK3 docking domain, were relevant for these redox characteristics. The C119S mutation decreased whereas the C162S mutation increased the dimer formation, suggesting that these two Cys residues act as vicinal thiols, consistent with C119S/C162S being incapable of sensing H2O2. Similarly, disulfide heterodimer formation was abolished in H9C2 cells expressing both MKK3 and p38&alpha; C119S/C162S and subjected to simulated ischemia and reperfusion. However, the p38&alpha; C119S/C162S mutants did not exhibit appreciable alteration in activating dual phosphorylation. In contrast, the anti-inflammatory agent 10-nitro-oleic acid (NO2-OA), a component of the Mediterranean diet, reduced p38&alpha; activation and covalently modified Cys-119/Cys-162, probably obstructing MKK3 access. Moreover, NO2-OA reduced the dephosphorylation of p38&alpha; by hematopoietic tyrosine phosphatase (HePTP). Furthermore, steric obstruction of Cys-119/Cys-162 by NO2-OA pretreatment in Langendorff-perfused murine hearts prevented the p38-MKK3 disulfide dimer formation and attenuated H2O2-induced contractile dysfunction. Our findings suggest that cysteine residues within p38&alpha; act as redox sensors that can dynamically regulate the association between p38 and MKK3.

	<b>Abstract</b>: Arterial hypertension continues to be a major health burden. Development of new antihypertensive drugs that engage vasodilatory mechanisms not harnessed by available therapies offer therapeutic potential. Oxidants induce an interprotein disulfide in PKG I (protein kinase G I) at C42, which is associated with its targeting and activation, resulting in vasodilation and blood pressure lowering. Consequently, we developed an assay and screened for electrophilic drugs that activate PKG I by selectively targeting C42, as such compounds have potential as novel antihypertensives with a mechanism of action that differs from current therapies. In this way, a drug that we termed G1 was identified, which targets C42 of PKG I to induce vasodilation of isolated resistance blood vessels and blood pressure lowering in a mouse model of angiotensin II-induced hypertension. In contrast, these antihypertensive effects were deficient in angiotensin II-induced hypertensive C42S PKG I knockin mice. These transgenic mice were engineered to have the reactive cysteinyl thiol replaced with a hydroxyl so that it cannot react with endogenous vasodilatory oxidants or electrophiles such as drug G1. These studies, therefore, provide validation of PKG I C42 as the target of G1, as well as proof-of-principle for a new class of antihypertensive drugs that have potential for further development for clinical use in humans.

	<b>Abstract</b>: The role and responses of the dimeric DJ-1 protein to cardiac oxidative stress is incompletely understood. H2 O2 induces a 50-kDa DJ-1 interprotein homodimer disulfide, known to form between Cys-53 on each subunit. A trimeric 75-kDa DJ-1 complex that mass spectrometry shows contained 2-Cys peroxiredoxin also formed and precedes the appearance of the disulfide dimer. These observations may represent peroxiredoxin sensing and transducing the oxidant signal to DJ-1. The dimeric disulfide DJ-1 complex was stabilized by auranofin, suggesting that thioredoxin recycles it in cells. Higher concentrations of H2 O2 concomitantly induce DJ-1 Cys-106 hyperoxidation (sulfination or sulfonation) in myocytes, perfused heart, or HEK cells. An oxidation-resistant C53A DJ-1 shows potentiated H2 O2 -induced Cys-106 hyperoxidation. DJ-1 also forms multiple disulfides with unknown target proteins during H2 O2 treatment, the formation of which is also potentiated in cells expressing the C53A mutant. This suggests that the intersubunit disulfide induces a conformational change that limits Cys-106 forming heterodisulfide protein complexes or from hyperoxidizing. High concentrations of H2 O2 also induce cell death, with DJ-1 Cys-106 sulfonation appearing causal in these events, as expression of C53A DJ-1 enhanced both Cys-106 sulfonation and cell death. Nonetheless, expression of the DJ-1 C106A mutant, which fully prevents hyperoxidation, also showed exacerbated cell death responses to H2 O2 . A rational explanation for these findings is that DJ-1 Cys-106 forms disulfides with target proteins to limit oxidantinduced cell death. However, when Cys-106 is hyperoxidized, formation of these potentially protective heterodimeric disulfide complexes is limited, and so cell death is exacerbated.

	<b>Abstract</b>: The gasotransmitter, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is recognized as an important mediator of endothelial cell homeostasis and function that impacts upon vascular tone and blood pressure. Cystathionine- &gamma;-lyase (CSE) is the predominant endothelial generator of H2S, and recent evidence suggests that its transcriptional expression is regulated by the reactive oxygen species, H2O2. However, the cellular source of H2O2 and the redox-dependent molecular signaling pathway that modulates this is not known. We aimed to investigate the role of Nox4, an endothelial generator of H2O2, in the regulation of CSE in endothelial cells. Both gain- and loss-of-function experiments in human endothelial cells in vitro demonstrated Nox4 to be a positive regulator of CSE transcription and protein expression.Wedemonstrate that this is dependent upon a heme-regulated inhibitor kinase/ eIF2&alpha;/activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) signaling module. ATF4 was further demonstrated to bind directly to cis-regulatory sequences within the first intron of CSE to activate transcription. Furthermore, CSE expression was also increased in cardiac microvascular endothelial cells, isolated from endothelial- specific Nox4 transgenic mice, compared with wild-type littermate controls. Using wire myography we demonstrate that endothelial-specific Nox4 transgenic mice exhibit a hypo-contractile phenotype in response to phenylephrine that was abolished when vessels were incubated with a CSE inhibitor, propargylglycine. We, therefore, conclude that Nox4 is a positive transcriptional regulator of CSE in endothelial cells and propose that it may in turn contribute to the regulation of vascular tone via the modulation of H2S production.

	<b>Abstract</b>: Phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors limit myocardial injury caused by stresses, including doxorubicin chemotherapy. cGMP binding to PKG I&alpha; attenuates oxidant-induced disulfide formation. Because PDE5 inhibition elevates cGMP and protects from doxorubicin-induced injury, we reasoned that this may be because it limits PKG I&alpha; disulfide formation. To investigate the role of PKG I&alpha; disulfide dimerization in the development of apoptosis, doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy was compared in male wild type (WT) or disulfide-resistant C42S PKG I&alpha; knock-in (KI) mice. Echocardiography showed that doxorubicin treatment caused loss of myocardial tissue and depressed left ventricular function in WT mice. Doxorubicin also reduced pro-survival signaling and increased apoptosis in WT hearts. In contrast, KI mice were markedly resistant to the dysfunction induced by doxorubicin in WTs. In follow-on experiments the influence of the PDE5 inhibitor tadalafil on the development of doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy in WT and KI mice was investigated. In WT mice, co-administration of tadalafil with doxorubicin reduced PKG I&alpha; oxidation caused by doxorubicin and also protected against cardiac injury and loss of function. KI mice were again innately resistant to doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity, and therefore tadalafil afforded no additional protection. Doxorubicin decreased phosphorylation of RhoA (Ser-188), stimulating its GTPase activity to activate Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) in WTs. These pro-apoptotic events were absent in KI mice and were attenuated in WTs coadministered tadalafil. PKG I&alpha; disulfide formation triggers cardiac injury, and this initiation of maladaptive signaling can be blocked by pharmacological therapies that elevate cGMP, which binds kinase to limit its oxidation.

	<b>Abstract</b>: Homeostatic cardiac function is maintained by a complex network of interdependent signaling pathways which become compromised during disease progression. Excitation-contraction-coupling, the translation of an electrical signal to a contractile response is critically dependent on a tightly controlled sequence of events culminating in a rise in intracellular Ca2+ and subsequent contraction of the myocardium. Dysregulation of this Ca2+ handling system as well as increases in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are two major contributing factors to myocardial disease progression. ROS, generated by cellular oxidases and by-products of cellular metabolism, are highly reactive oxygen derivatives that function as key secondary messengers within the heart and contribute to normal homeostatic function. However, excessive production of ROS, as in disease, can directly interact with kinases critical for Ca2+ regulation. This post-translational oxidative modification therefore links changes in the redox status of the myocardium to phospho-regulated pathways essential for its function. This review aims to describe the oxidative regulation of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) and cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), and the subsequent impact this has on Ca2+ handling within the myocardium. Elucidating the impact of alterations in intracellular ROS production on Ca2+ dynamics through oxidative modification of key ROS sensing kinases, may provide novel therapeutic targets for preventing myocardial disease progression.

	<b>Abstract</b>: Dysregulated blood pressure control leading to hypertension is prevalent and is a risk factor for several common diseases. Fully understanding blood pressure regulation offers the possibility of developing rationale therapies to alleviate hypertension and associated disease risks. Although hydrogen sulfde (Htextlessinftextgreater2textless/inftextgreaterS) is a well-established endogenous vasodilator, the molecular basis of its blood-pressure lowering action is incompletely understood. Htextlessinftextgreater2textless/inftextgreaterS-dependent vasodilation and blood pressure lowering in vivo was mediated by it catalyzing formation of an activating interprotein disulfde within protein kinase G (PKG) I&alpha;. However, this oxidative activation of PKG I&alpha; is counterintuitive because Htextlessinftextgreater2textless/inftextgreaterS is a thiol-reducing molecule that breaks disulfdes, and so it is not generally anticipated to induce their formation. This apparent paradox was explained by Htextlessinftextgreater2textless/inftextgreaterS in the presence of molecular oxygen or hydrogen peroxide rapidly converting to polysulfdes, which have oxidant properties that in turn activate PKG by inducing the disulfde. These observations are relevant in vivo because transgenic knockin mice in which the cysteine 42 redox sensor within PKG has been systemically replaced with a redox-dead serine residue are resistant to Htextlessinftextgreater2textless/inftextgreaterS-induced blood pressure lowering. Thus, a primary mechanism by which the reductant molecule Htextlessinftextgreater2textless/inftextgreaterS lowers blood pressure is mediated somewhat paradoxically by the oxidative activation of PKG.

	<b>Abstract</b>: Hydrogen peroxide regulates intracellular signaling by oxidatively converting susceptible cysteine thiols to a modified state, which includes the formation of intermolecular disulfides. This type of oxidative modification can occur within the cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases often referred to as PKA and PKG, which have important roles in regulating cardiac contractility and systemic blood pressure. Both kinases are stimulated through conical pathways that elevate their respective cyclic nucleotides leading to direct kinase stimulation. However, PKA and PKG can also be functionally modulated independently of cyclic nucleotide stimulation through direct cysteine thiol oxidation leading to intermolecular disulfide formation. In the case of PKG, the formation of an intermolecular disulfide between two parallel dimeric subunits leads to enhanced kinase affinity for substrate. For PKA, the formation of two intermolecular disulfides between antiparallel dimeric regulatory RI subunits increases the affinity of this kinase for its binding partners, the A-kinase anchoring proteins, leading to increased PKA localization to its substrates. In this chapter, we describe the methods for detecting intermolecular disulfide-bound proteins and monitoring PKA and PKG oxidation within biological samples. textcopyright 2013 Elsevier Inc.

	<b>Abstract</b>: Significance: Oxidants were once principally considered perpetrators of injury and disease. However, this has become an antiquated view, with cumulative evidence showing that the oxidant hydrogen peroxide serves as a signaling molecule. Hydrogen peroxide carries vital information about the redox state of the cell and is crucial for homeostatic regulation during health and adaptation to stress. Recent Advances: In this review, we examine the contemporary concepts for how hydrogen peroxide is sensed and transduced into a biological response by introducing post-translational oxidative modifications on select proteins. Oxidant sensing and signaling by kinases are of particular importance as they integrate oxidant signals into phospho-regulated pathways. We focus on CAMKII, PKA, and PKG, kinases whose redox regulation has notable impact on cardiovascular function. Critical Issues: In addition, we examine the mechanism for regulating intracellular hydrogen peroxide, considering the net concentrations that may accumulate. The effects of endogenously generated oxidants are often modeled by applying exogenous hydrogen peroxide to cells or tissues. Here we consider whether model systems exposed to exogenous hydrogen peroxide have relevance to systems where the oxidant is generated endogenously, and if so, what concentration can be justified in terms of relevance to health and disease. Future Directions: Improving our understanding of hydrogen peroxide signaling and the sensor proteins that it can modify will help us develop new strategies to regulate intracellular signaling to prevent disease. textcopyright 2013, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

	<b>Abstract</b>: Introduction: Reversible protein cysteine oxidation is recognised as a pivotal post-transitional modification that transduces physiological as well as pathological signalling. Pharmacological interventions that target specific sources of oxidant formation are currently being trialled to ascertain their potential ability to prevent disease progression. To determine the selectivity of such pharmacological treatments and to indentify new drug targets, a suitable method is required to detect target cysteine oxidation. Method: Using a polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based alkylating agent the reversible oxidation of target proteins can be determined using a novel switch method. After reduction and specific labelling of reversibly oxidised thiols with a 'heavy' PEG-tag, samples are resolved on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gels, Western blotted and immunostained for protein(s) of interest. A mobility shift in a target protein following PEG-alkylation correlates with the reversible oxidative modification. Results: The oxidation of cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases was detected using the PEG-switch assay in Langendorff-perfused hearts after hydrogen peroxide was administered. Discussion: The PEG-switch assay is a fast effective semi-quantitative method for measuring target reversible cysteine oxidation in complex protein mixtures derived from tissue or cultured cells. textcopyright 2013 Elsevier Inc.

	<b>Abstract</b>: We demonstrate for the first time that endomembrane-delimited H-Ras mediates VEGF-induced activation of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) and migratory response of human endothelial cells. Using thiol labeling strategies and immunofluorescent cell staining, we found that only 31% of total H-Ras is S-palmitoylated, tethering the small GTPase to the plasma membrane but leaving the function of the large majority of endomembrane-localized H-Ras unexplained. Knockdown of H-Ras blocked VEGF-induced PI3K-dependent Akt (Ser-473) and eNOS (Ser-1177) phosphorylation and nitric oxide-dependent cell migration, demonstrating the essential role of H-Ras. Activation of endogenous H-Ras led to recruitment and phosphorylation of eNOS at endomembranes. The loss of migratory response in cells lacking endogenous H-Ras was fully restored by modest overexpression of an endomembrane-delimited H-Ras palmitoylation mutant. These studies define a newly recognized role for endomembrane-localized H-Ras in mediating nitric oxide-dependent proangiogenic signaling. textcopyright 2013 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

	<b>Abstract</b>: Sepsis is a common life-threatening clinical syndrome involving complications as a result of severe infection. A cardinal feature of sepsis is inflammation that results in oxidative stress. Sepsis in wild-type mice induced oxidative activation of cGMP-dependent protein kinase 1 alpha (PKG I&alpha;), which increased blood vessel dilation and permeability, and also lowered cardiac output. These responses are typical features of sepsis and their combined effect is a lowering of blood pressure. This hypotension, a hallmark of sepsis, resulted in underperfusion of end organs, resulting in their damage. A central role for PKG I&alpha; oxidative activation in injury is supported by oxidation-resistant Cys42Ser PKG I&alpha; knock-in mice being markedly protected from these clinical indices of injury during sepsis. We conclude that oxidative activation of PKG I&alpha; is a key mediator of hypotension and consequential organ injury during sepsis.

	<b>Abstract</b>: Here we demonstrate a new paradigm in redox signaling, whereby oxidants resulting from metabolic stress directly alter protein palmitoylation by oxidizing reactive cysteine thiolates. In mice fed a high-fat, high-sucrose diet and in cultured endothelial cells (ECs) treated with high palmitate and high glucose (HPHG), there was decreased HRas palmitoylation on Cys181/184 (61Â±24% decrease for cardiac tissue and 38Â±7.0% in ECs). This was due to oxidation of Cys181/184, detected using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI TOF)-TOF. Decrease in HRas palmitoylation affected its compartmentalization and Ras binding domain binding activity, with a shift from plasma membrane tethering to Golgi localization. Loss of plasma membrane-bound HRas decreased growth factor-stimulated ERK phosphorylation (84Â±8.6% decrease) and increased apoptotic signaling (24Â±6.5-fold increase) after HPHG treatment that was prevented by overexpressing wild-type but not C181/184S HRas. The essential role of HRas in metabolic stress was made evident by the similar effects of expressing an inactive dominant negative N17-HRas or a MEK inhibitor. Furthermore, the relevance of thiol oxidation was demonstrated by overexpressing manganese superoxide dismutase, which improved HRas palmitoylation and ERK phosphorylation, while lessening apoptosis in HPHG treated ECs.

	<b>Abstract</b>: Redox signaling refers to the specific and usually reversible oxidation/reduction modification of molecules involved in cellular signaling pathways. In the heart, redox signaling regulates several physiological processes (eg, excitation-contraction coupling) and is involved in a wide variety of pathophysiological and homoeostatic or stress response pathways. Reactive oxygen species involved in cardiac redox signaling may derive from many sources, but NADPH oxidases, as dedicated sources of signaling reactive oxygen species, seem to be especially important. An increasing number of specific posttranslational oxidative modifications involved in cardiac redox signaling are being defined, along with the reactive oxygen species sources that are involved. Here, we review current knowledge on the molecular targets of signaling reactive oxygen species in cardiac cells and their involvement in cardiac physiopathology. Advances in this field may allow the development of targeted therapeutic strategies for conditions such as heart failure as opposed to the general antioxidant approaches that have failed to date. textcopyright 2012 American Heart Association, Inc.

	<b>Abstract</b>: Protein kinase G (PKG) is activated by nitric oxide (NO)-induced cGMP binding or alternatively by oxidant-induced interprotein disulfide formation. We found preactivation with cGMP attenuated PKG oxidation. 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4, 3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ) blockade of cGMP production increased disulfide PKG to 13Â±2% and 29Â±4% of total in aorta and mesenteries, respectively. This was potentially anomalous, because we observed 2.7-fold higher NO levels in aorta than mesenteries; consequently, we had anticipated that ODQ would induce more disulfide in the conduit vessel. ODQ also constricted aorta, whereas it had no effect on mesenteries. Thus, mesenteries, but not aorta, can compensate for loss of NO-cGMP by recruiting disulfide activation of PKG. Mechanistically, this is explained by loss of cGMP allowing disulfide formation in response to basal oxidant production. Why aorta treated with ODQ generated less PKG disulfide that is insufficient to induce vasoconstriction was unclear. One potential explanation, especially because aorta were much less sensitive than mesenteries to exogenous H2O2-induced relaxation (EC50=205Â±24 and 33Â±2 &mu;mol/L, respectively) was that conduit vessels may have higher peroxidase capacity. Indeed, we found that aorta express 49Â±22% and 80Â±25% more peroxiredoxin and thioredoxin, respectively, than mesenteries, and their 2-Cys peroxiredoxin peroxidatic cysteines were also less sensitive to hyperoxidation. The higher peroxidase capacity of aortas would explain their constriction during cGMP removal and their insensitivity to H2O2-induced relaxation compared with mesenteries. In summary, cGMP binding to PKG induces a state that is resistant to disulfide formation. Consequently, cGMP depletion sensitizes PKG to oxidation; this happens to a lesser extent in aortas than in mesenteries, because the conduit vessels generate more NO and express more peroxiredoxin. textcopyright 2012 American Heart Association, Inc.

	<b>Abstract</b>: Significance: Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species contributing to homeostatic regulation and the pathogenesis of various cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis, hypertension, endothelial dysfunction, and cardiac hypertrophy, is well established. The ability of oxidant species to mediate such effects is in part dependent on their ability to induce specific modifications on particular amino acids, which alter protein function leading to changes in cell signaling and function. The thiol containing amino acids, methionine and cysteine, are the only oxidized amino acids that undergo reduction by cellular enzymes and are, therefore, prime candidates in regulating physiological signaling. Various reports illustrate the significance of reversible oxidative modifications on cysteine thiols and their importance in modulating cardiovascular function and physiology. Recent Advances: The use of mass spectrometry, novel labeling techniques, and live cell imaging illustrate the emerging importance of reversible thiol modifications in cellular redox signaling and have advanced our analytical abilities. Critical Issues: Distinguishing redox signaling from oxidative stress remains unclear. S-nitrosylation as a precursor of S-glutathionylation is controversial and needs further clarification. Subcellular distribution of glutathione (GSH) may play an important role in local regulation, and targeted tools need to be developed. Furthermore, cellular redundancies of thiol metabolism complicate analysis and interpretation. Future Directions: The development of novel pharmacological analogs that specifically target subcellular compartments of GSH to promote or prevent local protein S-glutathionylation as well as the establishment of conditional gene ablation and transgenic animal models are needed. textcopyright 2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

	<b>Abstract</b>: Background-Although nitroglycerin has remained in clinical use since 1879, the mechanism by which it relaxes blood vessels to lower blood pressure remains incompletely understood. Nitroglycerin undergoes metabolism that generates several reaction products, including oxidants, and this bioactivation process is essential for vasodilation. Protein kinase G (PKG) mediates classic nitric oxide-dependent vasorelaxation, but the 1&alpha; isoform is also independently activated by oxidation that involves interprotein disulfide formation within this homodimeric protein complex. We hypothesized that nitroglycerin-induced vasodilation is mediated by disulfide activation of PKG1&alpha;. Methods and Results-Treating smooth muscle cells or isolated blood vessels with nitroglycerin caused PKG1&alpha; disulfide dimerization. PKG1&alpha; disulfide formation was increased in wild-type mouse aortas by in vivo nitroglycerin treatment, but this oxidation was lost as tolerance developed. To establish whether kinase oxidation underlies nitroglycerin-induced vasodilation in vivo, we used a Cys42Ser PKG1&alpha; knock-in mouse that cannot transduce oxidant signals because it does not contain the vital redox-sensing thiol. This redox-dead knock-in mouse was substantively deficient in hypotensive response to nitroglycerin compared with wild-type littermates as measured in vivo by radiotelemetry. Resistance blood vessels from knock-ins were markedly less sensitive to nitroglycerin-induced vasodilation (EC 50=39.2Â±10. 7 &mu;mol/L) than wild-types (EC 50=12.1Â±2.9 &mu;mol/L). Furthermore, after â‰ˆ24 hours of treatment, wild-type controls stopped vasodilating to nitroglycerin, and the vascular sensitivity to nitroglycerin was decreased, whereas this tolerance phenomenon, which routinely hampers the management of hypertensive patients, was absent in knock-ins. Conclusions-PKG1&alpha; disulfide formation is a significant mediator of nitroglycerin-induced vasodilation, and tolerance to nitroglycerin is associated with loss of kinase oxidation. textcopyright 2012 American Heart Association, Inc.

	<b>Abstract</b>: Elevated protein oxidation is a widely reported hallmark of most major diseases. Historically, this 'oxidative stress' has been considered causatively detrimental, as the protein oxidation events were interpreted simply as damage. However, recent advances have changed this antiquated view; sensitive methodology for detecting and identifying proteins susceptible to oxidation has revealed a fundamental role for this modification in physiological cell signalling during health. Reversible protein oxidation that is dynamically coupled with cellular reducing systems allows oxidative protein modifications to regulate protein function, analogous to phosphoregulation. However, the relatively labile nature of many reversible protein oxidation states hampers the reliable detection and identification of modified proteins. Consequently, specialized methods to stabilize protein oxidation in combinationwith techniques to detect specific types of modification have been developed. Here, these techniques are discussed, and their sensitivity, selectivity and ability to reliably identify reversibly oxidized proteins are critically assessed. textcopyrightThe Authors Journal compilation textcopyright2011 Biochemical Society.

	<b>Abstract</b>: Formation of nitric oxide and its derivative reactive nitrogen species during endotoxemia has been implicated in the pathogenesis of the associated cardiovascular dysfunction. This stress can promote nitrosative post-translational modifications of proteins that may alter their activity and contribute to dysregulation. We utilized the ascorbate-dependent biotin-switch method to assay protein S-nitrosylation and immunoblotted for tyrosine nitration to monitor changes in nitrosative protein oxidation during endotoxemia. Hearts from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated rats showed no apparent variation in global protein S-nitrosylation, but this may be due to the poor sensitivity of the biotin-switch method. To sensitize our monitoring of protein S-nitrosylation we exposed isolated hearts to the efficient trans-nitrosylating agent nitrosocysteine (which generated a robust biotin-switch signal) and then identified a number of target proteins using mass spectrometry. We were then able to probe for these target proteins in affinity-capture preparations of S-nitrosylated proteins prepared from vehicle- or LPS-treated animals. Unexpectedly this showed a time-dependent loss in S-nitrosylation during sepsis, which we hypothesized, may be due to concomitant superoxide formation that may lower nitric oxide but simultaneously generate the tyrosine-nitrating agent peroxynitrite. Indeed, this was confirmed by immunoblotting for global tyrosine nitration, which increased time-dependently and temporally correlated with a decrease in mean arterial pressure. We assessed if tyrosine nitration was causative in lowering blood pressure using the putative peroxynitrite scavenger FeTPPS. However, FeTPPS was ineffective in reducing global protein nitration and actually exacerbated LPS-induced hypotension. textcopyright 2010 Published by Elsevier Inc.

	<b>Abstract</b>: Rationale: 15-Deoxy-&Delta;-prostaglandin (15d-PG)J2 is an electrophilic oxidant that dilates the coronary vasculature. This lipid can adduct to redox active protein thiols to induce oxidative posttranslational modifications that modulate protein and tissue function. Objective: To investigate the role of oxidative protein modifications in 15d-PGJ 2-mediated coronary vasodilation and define the distal signaling pathways leading to enhanced perfusion. Methods and Results: Proteomic screening with biotinylated 15d-PGJ2 identified novel vascular targets to which it adducts, most notably soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH). 15d-PGJ 2 inhibited sEH by specifically adducting to a highly conserved thiol (Cys521) adjacent to the catalytic center of the hydrolase. Indeed a Cys521Ser sEH "redox-dead" mutant was resistant to 15d-PGJ2-induced hydrolase inhibition. 15d-PGJ2 dilated coronary vessels and a role for hydrolase inhibition was supported by 2 structurally different sEH antagonists each independently inducing vasorelaxation. Furthermore, 15d-PGJ2 and sEH antagonists also increased coronary effluent epoxyeicosatrienoic acids consistent with their vasodilatory actions. Indeed 14,15-EET alone induced relaxation and 15d-PGJ2-mediated vasodilation was blocked by the EET receptor antagonist 14,15-epoxyeicosa-5(Z)-enoic acid (14,15-EEZE). Additionally, the coronary vasculature of sEH-null mice was basally dilated compared to wild-type controls and failed to vasodilate in response to 15d-PGJ2. Coronary vasodilation to hypoxia in wild-types was accompanied by 15d-PGJ2 adduction to and inhibition of sEH. Consistent with the importance of hydrolase inhibition, sEH-null mice failed to vasodilate during hypoxia. CONCLUSION:: This represents a new paradigm for the regulation of sEH by an endogenous lipid, which is integral to the fundamental physiological response of coronary hypoxic vasodilation.

	<b>Abstract</b>: The control of vascular smooth muscle contractility enables regulation of blood pressure, which is paramount in physiological adaptation to environmental challenges. Maintenance of stable blood pressure is crucial for health as deregulation (caused by high or low blood pressure) leads to disease progression. Vasotone is principally controlled by the cyclic nucleotide dependent protein kinases A and G, which regulate intracellular calcium and contractile protein calcium sensitivity. The classical pathways for activation of these two kinases are well established and involve the formation and activation by specific cyclic nucleotide second messengers. Recently we reported that both PKA and PKG can be regulated independently of their respective cyclic nucleotides via a mechanism whereby the kinases sense cellular oxidant production using redox active thiols. This novel redox regulation of these kinases is potentially of physiological importance, and may synergise with the classical regulatory mechanisms. textcopyright 2010 by the authors.

	<b>Abstract</b>: Arrays of chemical oxidants are produced in healthy cells, where they function as important signaling molecules that are crucial in homeostatic regulation and cellular adaptation. The molecular basis of redox signaling is a series of oxido-reductive chemical reactions in which oxidants or reductants post-translationally alter the structure of proteins. These modifications equate to signal sensing events, in which an alteration in protein redox status may couple to a change in its function. This coupling of sensing to function is a true transduction event, allowing conversion of the cellular redox state into altered enzymatic activities. Here we review redox signaling in the cardiovascular system, considering the variety of post-translational oxidative modifications that explain redox sensing and signal transduction by proteins at the molecular level.

	<b>Abstract</b>: The phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitor sildenafil has powerful cardioprotective effects against ischemia-reperfusion injury. PKG-mediated signaling has been implicated in this protection, although the mechanism and the downstream targets of this kinase remain to be fully elucidated. In this study we assessed the role of phospholemman (PLM) phosphorylation, which activates the Na+/K+-ATPase, in cardioprotection afforded by sildenafil administered during reperfusion. Isolated perfused mouse hearts were optimally protected against infarction (indexed by tetrazolium staining) by 0.1 &mu;M sildenafil treatment during the first 10 min of reperfusion. Extended sildenafil treatment (30, 60, or 120 min at reperfusion) did not alter the degree of protection provided. This protection was PKG dependent, since it was blocked by KT-5823. Western blot analysis using phosphospecific antibodies to PLM showed that sildenafil at reperfusion did not modulate PLM Ser63 or Ser68 phosphorylation but significantly increased Ser69 phosphorylation. The treatment of isolated rat ventricular myocytes with sildenafil or 8-bromo-cGMP (PKG agonist) enhanced PLM Ser69 phosphorylation, which was bisindolylmaleimide (PKC inhibitor) sensitive. Patch-clamp studies showed that sildenafil treatment also activated the Na+/K+-ATPase, which is anticipated in light of PLM Ser69 phosphorylation. Na+/K+-ATPase activation during reperfusion would attenuate Na+ overload at this time, providing a molecular explanation of how sildenafil guards against injury at this time. Indeed, using flame photometry and rubidium uptake into isolated mouse hearts, we found that sildenafil enhanced Na+/K +-ATPase activity during reperfusion. In this study we provide a molecular explanation of how sildenafil guards against myocardial injury during postischemic reperfusion. Copyright textcopyright 2010 the American Physiological Society.

	<b>Abstract</b>: Sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) is an NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase that is sensitive to oxidative signals. Our purpose was to determine whether SIRT1 activity is sensitive to the low molecular weight nitrosothiol, S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), which can transduce oxidative signals into physiological responses. SIRT1 formed mixed disulfides with GSNO-Sepharose, and mass spectrometry identified several cysteines that are modified by GSNO, including Cys-67 which was S-glutathiolated. GSNO had no effect on basal SIRT1deacetylase activity, but inhibited stimulation of activity by resveratrol (RSV) with an IC50 of 69&mu;M. These observations indicate that S-glutathiolation of SIRT1 by low concentrations of reactive glutathione can modulate its enzymatic activity. textcopyright 2010, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

	<b>Abstract</b>: The transnitrosylating nitric oxide (NO) donor nitrocysteine (CysNO) induced a disulfide bond between the two regulatory RI subunits of protein kinase A (PKA). The conventional NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine failed to do this, consistent with our observation that it also did not promote protein S-nitrosylation. This disulfide oxidation event activated PKA and induced vasorelaxation independently of the classical &beta;-adrenergic or NO signaling pathway. Activation of PKA had also been anticipated to exert a positive inotropic effect on the myocardium but did not. The lack of positive inotropy was explained by CysNO concomitantly activating protein kinase G (PKG) I&alpha;. PKG was found to exert a partial negative inotropic influence regardless of whether PKA was activated by classical &beta;-receptor stimulation or by disulfide bond formation. This work demonstrates that NO molecules that can induce S-nitrosylation directly activate type I PKA, providing a novel cross-talk to &beta;-adrenergic-like signaling without receptor or adenylate cyclase stimulation. However, the expected positive inotropic consequences of PKA activation by this novel mechanism are countermanded by the simultaneous dual activation of PKGI&alpha;, which is also activated by CysNO. textcopyright 2009 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

	<b>Abstract</b>: Changes in the concentration of oxidants in cells can regulate biochemical signaling mechanisms that control cell function. We have found that guanosine 3â€²,5â€²-monophosphate (cGMP) - dependent protein kinase (PKG) functions directly as a redox sensor. The I&alpha; isoform, PKGI&alpha;, formed an interprotein disulfide linking its two subunits in cells exposed to exogenous hydrogen peroxide. This oxidation directly activated the kinase in vitro, and in rat cells and tissues. The affinity of the kinase for substrates it phosphorylates was enhanced by disulfide formation. This oxidation-induced activation represents an alternate mechanism for regulation along with the classical activation involving nitric oxide and cGMP. This mechanism underlies cGMP-independent vasorelaxation in response to oxidants in the cardiovascular system and provides a molecular explanation for how hydrogen peroxide can operate as an endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor.

	<b>Abstract</b>: Here we demonstrate that type I protein kinase A is redoxactive, forming an interprotein disulfide bond between its two regulatory RI subunits in response to cellular hydrogen peroxide. This oxidative disulfide formation causes a subcellular translocation and activation of the kinase, resulting in phosphorylation of established substrate proteins. The translocation is mediated at least in part by the oxidized form of the kinase having an enhanced affinity for &alpha;-myosin heavy chain, which serves as a protein kinase A (PKA) anchor protein and localizes the PKA to its myofilament substrates troponin I and myosin binding protein C. The functional consequence of these events in cardiac myocytes is that hydrogen peroxide increases contractility independently of &beta;-adrenergic stimulation and elevations of cAMP. The oxidant-induced phosphorylation of substrate proteins and increased contractility is blocked by the kinase inhibitor H89, indicating that these events involve PKA activation. In essence, type I PKA contains protein thiols that operate as redox sensors, and their oxidation by hydrogen peroxide directly activates the kinase. textcopyright 2006 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.
